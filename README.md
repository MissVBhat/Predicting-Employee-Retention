Understanding and improving employee retention is crucial for a technology company aiming to build a loyal and committed workforce. Traditionally, the organisation has focused on addressing turnover reactively, but it now seeks a data-driven approach to proactively identify employees likely to stay and the key factors influencing retention. Employee attrition affects productivity, increases hiring costs and disrupts team dynamics. Relying solely on exit interviews and historical trends limits the ability to take timely action. A predictive model enables HR to identify patterns, anticipate retention risks and tailor strategies to improve employee engagement and satisfaction. Hence we have developed a logistic regression model to predict employee retention based on demographic details, job satisfaction scores, performance metrics and tenure. By leveraging these insights, the company can refine its retention strategies, foster a more supportive work environment and enhance workforce stability and satisfaction.
